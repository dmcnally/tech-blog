# Feature Flags

Merge to master regularly

Put new/incomplete features behind feature flags.

The first step of any new piece of development work is deciding on the name the its feature flag.

Incomplete features get merged, pushed to master and deployed to production.

With everything behind feature flags even removing features is easy.
